Data structures and algorithms in C++
===================================

The repository contains implementations of different data structures and algorithms in C/C++. They are intended to be used as educational examples.

The examples are grouped in directories, by topic, as follows:

## Contents

### Array Waling
A simple demonstration of the effects of locality on performance.

### DynamicArray
1. **Simple** - A simple, C-style implementation
2. **DynamicArray** - An object-oriented implementation. Also demonstrates proxies, operator ovearloading.

### Hash
Contains implementations of separate chaining and linear probing hashes

### LabyrinthBoard
Demonstrates breadth-first and depth-first searching over a square, chess-like board.

### LinkedList
An implementation of a linked list

### Sorting
1. **Sorting** - Implementations of the most popular sorting algorithms. Also includes unit tests.
2. merge-sort-simple-2016.cpp - a very simple (50 lines) merge sort
3. merge-sort-linked-list.cpp - generic merge sort over templated linked ist
4. merge-sort-static-list.cpp - merge sort on static list (not so smart implementation)

### Stack
1. **Stack** - contains static, fixed size and linked implementations of a stack.
2. **StackTest** - demonstrates the use of unit tests, using a custom unit test framework.

### Combinatorial & Data Structures w/STL
1. combinations-2016.cpp - gen all combinations of N elements K class
2. huffman-modernist.2016.cpp - brief huffman coding w/C++11 stuff in it
3. maze-recursive.2016.cpp - walking a maze in plain C
4. fsm-simple.stl-2016.cpp - some C++11 magic put to work into simple Finite State Automata
